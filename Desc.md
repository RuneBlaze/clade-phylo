# Description of Algorithm

Input: binary mul-trees t[1] ... t[n] in a single file where labels are integers, in Newick format. To accomodate SimPhy, labels in the format of "x_y_z" are taken to be simply "x".

Output: the maximal elements (by subset) of the singly labeled clades generated by some unrooted subtree of some `t`, along with
the trees that generated these clades.


## Procedure

In mul-trees, clades (unrooted or rooted) are stored as multisets. Trees are stored as rooted. 

 1. Take the input mul-trees. From bottom up, calculate all the
 the rooted clades for each tree.
 2. Initialize set of rooted trees S
 2. For each tree in the input, for each edge of that tree v -> u, consider the two trees generated by deleting that edge. Root the two trees by u and v respectively. The two unrooted clades induced by v -> u are the rooted clade at u, and the relative compliment of the rooted clade at u w.r.t the rooted clade of the root of the tree. For each of the two unrooted clades, if it is singly labeled, add the tree generating it to S. (This should hopefully extract all unrooted clades correctly from all trees)
 4. Consider S as a poset, where a <= b if the leafset of a is a subset of the leafset of b. Take the maximal elements of S. Output the clades of maximal elements of S, along with the maximal elements of S.
